## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

‚ùóÔ∏è**Title**: `What is the title of your project? Be creative! 
My tile of the project was, "Snake Game with turtle Graphic"
.`

‚ùó**Purpose**: `In a single sentence, describe WHAT your project will do.
 Decide what the game should do, like making the snake move, eat food, and when it should end. `

‚ùóÔ∏è**Source Assignment(s)**: `List which original assignments you will base your project on? 
MY original assigment was t03, boustrophedon.
`

‚ùóÔ∏è**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")

‚ùóÔ∏è**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: Shenderaz

```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    ** Its going Okay, I thought i was going to be faster since its just snake game but theirs a lot of turtle 
    stuff to add. It took me a while to creat a window and head than it tought it was going to take. 
    Overall, I'm doing well, I did the most important part today, windown and head. I will directions and movements next time. 
```

---

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

‚ùóÔ∏è**Completion Percentage**: `0 - 100%`

‚ùóÔ∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    *
    Feeling cofident, even tho I still have to make my snake move. I got the segment in and the arrow keys working
    I still have a lot of work to make sure the scoreboard is more clear and check for collision with a body segment.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

Once you run the program in PyCharm, a window titled "Snake Game" will appear, displaying a green background where the game takes place.
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake: Up to move up, Down to move down, Left to move left, and Right to move right. 
The objective is to guide the snake to eat the brown food circles, which will appear at random positions. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, 
and your score increases by 5 points. Avoid colliding with the green borders or the snake's own body, as this will reset the game, clear the snake's body, and reset your score to zero, 
But your highest score will be saved as the "High Score." The current score and high score are displayed at the top of the screen throughout the game.

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

The snake moves at a fixed speed, which might feel too slow for some players.
-Players can change the speed depending how faster the player want to go.

The screen board might be hard to see for some people
-The player can change to where they can be able to see. 

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
I didn't know if you can create games in python, actual games, apart from the nim game and the first thing that i thought
about was to create a fun and easy game that my siblings can play at home.
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
Pretty close
- What did you learn from this process?
The top down design is very import, I was lost most of the time, when i try to do it without go based on my design. 

- What was the hardest part of the final project?
The hardest part of this game was to make the snake move and not collided with each other.

- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
I will make my design more clear before i jump to the coding section.
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
